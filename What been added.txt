#  v0.0.1 is named this since the v0.1 is updates getting to main
v0.0.1:
	1. Fixed Shield bug (does not decrease HP per tick, only decreases per hitbox entry)
	2. Fixed Enemy bug (the melee enemy sometimes hits the collision multiple times causing an insta kill) -
		made hitbox bigger than the body collision shape due to triggering the body instead of the hitbox
	3. Fixed Projectile (Issue sometiems projectile does not damage player)
	4. Fixed blurry font (added roboto font)
	5. Added a Stair area that slows down the player
	6. Updated move speed animation to sync to the current move speed
	7. Adjusted zoom level to be x2.5
	8. Added a limit to the camera area (clamps down the camera to a certain defined area)
	9. Added a new heal() method to HealthComponent
	10. Added bounce function to projectile
	11. Added shield block bounce
	12. Reverted hurtbox scale (1.01x -> 1x)
	13. Added GDUnit4 for tests
	14. Added previous tests from sprint-2
	15. Fixed blurry sprites when moving (Set physics interpolation to on)
	16. Changed all _process to _physics_process (Going forward, must use _physics_process instead for optimization)
	17. Added a new died signal to HealthComponent
		- this will emit when the health reaches 0
	18. Modified the death animation to use the new died signal
	19. Adjusted default viewport to be 1280x720 (Project Settings -> Display -> Size)
	20. Fixed stretch of the display of different resolutions to expand and zoom instead of zooming out of the camera
