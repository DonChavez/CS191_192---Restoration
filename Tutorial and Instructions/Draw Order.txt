Draw Order simply dictates which sprite will be drawn first
By default, the draw order (as seen in the scenes) is based on bottom to top
the nodes placed on the bottom will be drawn first (above everything else) and the nodes at the highest will be drawn last and be placed at the bottom

in the BaseTestingArea Scene, the Hill Layer is made a child of the ground layer for simplicity
This is done since the Hill layer is an Add-on to the ground layer

This is determined by the objects Z-index in the ordering section on the Inspector
a lower Z-index value means that the object is drawn lower than the other objects
For instance, tree = Z: 0 and fence = Z: 1 -> fence will be above the tree

How to set the draw order automatically:
	Enable Y-sort on the root node / parent node
	For instance, in thie tutorial Scene, enabling the Y-sort on the Tutorial Node automatically draws all objects inside, the object layer, player, enemy, etc. relative to how they should appear
	Example: player is behind the top of the tree, but in front of the trunk
