To create a tilemap, we have to use the TilemapLayer
Similar to how the characterbody2d works, we have to select a tileset
in the Inspector, simply select a new tiles then at the bottom of the console, select the "TileSet" option and choose the needed tileset
Godot will automatically set the pixels but can simply be edited by selecting the "setup" option
to group an entire object in 1 pixel, for instance a tree, hold control and drag

Add-ons

Physics Layers:
	when turning on the physics layers, this allows us to add collision layers on the tilesets
	the collision layers can then be painted by going to Tileset -> Paint -> Paint Properties -> Physics layer
	simply draw around the needed parts that need to have collisions

Terrains:
	Terrains make certain tilemappings easier
	for instance, a whole elevated platform, a whole field of dirt, etc. 
	to do this, simply go to TileMapLayer -> Terrain Sets -> Add Element -> Add Element
	after such, go to the paint tool in the tilesets, then select the tiles that will be used for the terrain
	after selecting, highlight (hold left click) on the innards of the terrain
	for example: 
		on the hill: draw on the hill side and avoid the walls
		on the dirt: draw on the dirt, avoid the grass
