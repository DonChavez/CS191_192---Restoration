The way the camera works in the scenes 

Camera is made a child of the node simply so that it makes it easier to shift focus from an object to another
Example: 
	Player focus:
		by making the camera a child of the player, the camera will always focus on the player
		instead, we use RemoteTransform2D and connect that to the camera in order to focus on the player
		This is done so that it will be easier to shift focus when necessary
		
other issues:
	when switching layers, making the camera a child of the player causes certain errors. to fix it, we do the process as stated above
