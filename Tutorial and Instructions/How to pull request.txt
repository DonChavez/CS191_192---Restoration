When making a pull request, there is a new workflow where all PRs will auto append the
"Updates/What's been added.txt" to "updates_log.txt". This is automatic so review PRs 
before merging.

Make sure to follow the format:

branch name: [Insert branch name here]
v0.0.1 # Update version here
	[List of changes in the version]

Example:

branch name: reset_julian
v0.0.1
	1. Changed something
