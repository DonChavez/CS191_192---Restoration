.monitorable and .monitoring are functions inherited from the Area2D node

.monitorable: 
	this allow other objects (Static bodies) to be able to detect the area
	Passive

.monitoring: 
	this makes it so that the Area2D itself looks for other bodies to detect
	active
	
by default, these functions are set to true, meaning that as an Area2D exists in a scene, it will, by default, try to collide with other bodies

Usage in the code: 
	the temporary shield:
		the shield uses these functions in order to activate and deactivate itself
		it's important to set both parameters to false or true, respectively, in order to ensure while it's deactivated, it won't affect anything in the scene
		essentially, by setting both parameters to false, it basically looks like the shield has been queue_free()'d from the scene 
	The Collectables:
		Instances have a spawn animation and the Area2D Monitoring is set to false while it plays
