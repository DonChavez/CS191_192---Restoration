Current Convensions are: 
	Environment = Layer 1
	Player = Layer 2
	Enemies = Layer 3
	
	note: to check layer settings, click on collisions -> triple dots on the right
	
Layer: 
	this represents which section the object can be touched. 
	In a sense, this is where they live/sit in the game
	
Mask: 
	this represents what the object can see.
	specifically, regardless of what layer an object is in, the object will be able to collide with any layer stated in its mask
	
Example:
	Player is in Layer 1 
	Enemy is in Layer 2
	Normally, these wouldn't collide
	but, if Enemy's mask is stated to see Layer 1, Enemy can thus collide with the Player (Layer 1)
	
How to Adust the Layers:
	The layer settings on the base scene of the object will be its default
	however, the layer settings can actually be changed depending on the needs of the scene
	
	Example:
		player base scene is set to Layer 2, but in the tutorial scene, it's layer is set to 1
		without masks, that means the player can collide with the environment in the tutorial scene
	
	The layers can also be adjusted in the script itself using set_collision_layer

Enemy Collision adjustment:
	for the hurtbox of the enemy to work properly, set the hurtbox collision to a few points higher than the base collision in order for it to connect and register properly with the player's hitbox
