groups are a collection of mutiple nodes. you can easily access to different groups
instead of manually determining if a hitbox is an enemy or a player

there are currently 4 groups:
- Enemy
- Player
- Shield
- TSHitbox

when you want to assign a node to a group, all of its children will also asign to the parent group

Select a node in the scene -> Node panel -> Groups

you can know if a node is under a group by the square with a circle in the middle

if you want to add/remove by code:
	
add_to_group("Enemy")
remove_from_group("enemy")

if you want to access a group:
	
if is_in_group("Player"):
	# do something
