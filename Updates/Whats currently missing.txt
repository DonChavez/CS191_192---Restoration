Entire Inventory Management System:
	Coin Management, Item Management, etc. still aren't here currently since I'm still Confused on how to do it and I've been getting a lot of errors recently - Julian

Level Manager:
	still have to do the global level manager stuff to keep the player's details
	
Portal Tutorial and LevelManager Tutorial:
	still need to fully understand how the system works and make a tutorial on how to do it
	
EliteEnemy:
	fix the collision of the elite enemy
	
Shield:
	add bouncing function

Healing:
	current implementation of healing is that the player should not be blocking
	this is only true if the player tries to pick up health items
	however, the player should be able to heal while they are in block mode if it's a heal-over-time scenario
	
Sprint 3:
	Still have to do parrying and global pollution level
	
Testings: 
	Will do the testings after finishing the essentials
