Player input bug:
	When the inventory is open and exiting the recyler, it overwrites disable_player_input
	and enables it while the inventory is still open
Trash Can Issue:
	Cleaning Trash Can should stop upon another input after interact.
	Unfortunately, _process is too fast and it triggers in the same key press.
	Added an await with a set value to minimize and hide problem
	Still an issue that needs a different implementation

Pollution Level Bug: 
	PL does not reset after switching levels

HUD Information:
	HUD is still not integrated yet with the backend

Player Sprite:
	No sprites yet for the animation

Player Health Bar:
	Upgraded Health % is not 100%
