Shield bug: 
	does not decrease HP per tick, only decreases per hitbox entry

Enemy bug:
	the melee enemy sometimes hits the collision multiple times causing an insta kill
	often happens when the player runs into the enemy causing jittering and thus colliding multiple times
	probable fix: player knockback and short invulnerability

Portal bug: 
	Player spawns at the top-left section of the scene instead of where the player is actually placed
	for instance, in scene NextTestingArea, the player is placed at the bottom-left naturally, but when interacting with the portal, the player gets spawned in the top-left
