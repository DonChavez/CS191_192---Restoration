# v0.0.1 is named this since the .0.1 is updates getting to main
v0.0.1:
	1. incereased the PlayerHitbox scale from x = y = 1 to x = y = 1.01 -> done in order to increase the chances of the player hitbox colliding with hurtboxes
	2. fixed the bug with the player's hitbox sometimes not activating -> .monitorable and .monitoring was added to the tempo_shield and the shield_hitbox to fully enable and disable the shield
	3. Created new Scene: NextTestingArea -> connected to the BaseTestingArea to highlight Portal functionality
	4. Created the portal that allows player to be transported
	5. Added the code in the LevelManager that allows the player to be transported
