branch: reset_sean
v0.0.6:
	1. Added 3 new items (SpeedTestItem - for testing, Ricochet, Spread Shot) - these are projectile items that modifies player projectiles
	2. Projectile bounce overhaul 
		- bounce() now just normally bounces off a surface instead of bouncing to an enemy nearby
		- redirect_to_nearest_enemy() this is the old bounce function 
		- added (@export var MaxBounces = 0) for bouncing functionality
		- added (var bounce_count: int = 0 ) to track projectile bounces
	3. Added new features to Player.gd
		- added 2 new shooting variables 
			- Projectile_bounce_count - total bounces of player projectiles
			- Spread_shot_count - additional bullets to shoot per shot
		- modified shoot_projectile to allow mutiple bullets at onnect
		- added 2 new interaction variables
			- Can_process_input - checks if it can read inputs (except movement)
			- Can_process_movement - checks if it allows the player to move
	4. Changed Inventory from node2d to CanvasLayer (to make sure it sticks to the viewport UI instead of the scene)
	5. Added new functionality to inventory (it now applies every item effect inside invetory)
	6. Added new items now inherit from class ItemObject
	7. Player now cannot perform combat actions while inside the inventory UI and near the Recycler
	8. Placed the 3 new items in the HubTestingArea
	9. Added new functionality for LevelManager (to support transitions in the future and error handling)

	Others
	1. Fixed bug (Collectables collide with player from previous location upon interacting with portal) 
		- sets the player position to PlayerSpawn before adding it as a child to the scene
	2. Fixed visual bug (screen tearing) - a bug in the Forward+ renderer and now tearing when game is exported
